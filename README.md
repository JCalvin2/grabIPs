Grabs IPs from Hostnames
This file takes in a txt file of hostnames (one per line). It will output a file called IPs.txt with the IPs from these given hostnames. 
If hosts are offline they will be inputted into the offlineHosts.txt.
The input file & python file need to be in the same directory/folder to work.
